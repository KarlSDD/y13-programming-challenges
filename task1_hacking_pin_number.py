"""
Thief!

A thief has managed to find out the four digits for an online PIN code, but doesnâ€™t know the correct sequence needed to
hack into the account.

Design and write a program that appends all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the user.
The program should avoid displaying the same combination more than once.

If the function receives invalid data, it should return -1
