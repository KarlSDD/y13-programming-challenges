Letters-odd-even

Even more Odd
Create a program that accepts a random list of integers and chars then puts them in order.

The rules for ordering are as follows - alphabetical for chars, small to large for integers - and then
all of the elements in the following order: characters, odd numbers, even numbers.

The return value will be your newly sorted list.

E.g. [12, 17, 'a', 'h', 4, 1, 5, 'f', 8, 'z'] will become ['a', 'f', 'h', 'z', 1, 5, 17, 4, 8, 12]
